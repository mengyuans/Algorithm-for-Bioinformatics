# Algorithm-for-Bioinformatics
### This repo is created under subject Algorithm for Bioinformatics at the University of Melbourne.

The subject covers key algorithms used in bioinformatics, with a focus on genomics. Indicative topics are: sequence alignment (dynamic algorithms and seed-and-extend), genome assembly, variant detection, phylogenetic reconstruction, genomic intervals, complexity and correctness of algorithms, clustering and classification of genomics data, data reduction and visualisation.
The subject assumes you have experience in programming and familiarity with the foundations of genomics.
